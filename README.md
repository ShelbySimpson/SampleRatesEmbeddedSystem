#SampleRatesEmbeddedSystems
This program was written to work with an Arduino board.
Data retrived from an onboard sliding potentiometer was
used to determine the data sampling rate from an onboard
microphone and light sensor. A onboard switch was used for
determining which sensor would be used. A onboard button was
used to initaite sampling.
